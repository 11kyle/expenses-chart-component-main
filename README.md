## Overview
This is my first project on Frontend Mentor so I'm going with a newbie project that I like, the qr-code-component. I want to over estimate on my first project because I think that it's better than under estimating. I also want to be close on my estimation because I feel like that is very important in a professional environment. I also want to note that I'm currently not using the Pro version so I don't have access to the Figma files but I do want to incorporate a designing and project plan phase in my estimate.

- Planning: 0.5 hours
- Analysis: 0.5 hours
- Design: 0 (Already completed)
- Development: 2 hour
- Testing: 1 hour
- Maintenance: 0 (Not in the scope)

Total: 4 hours

## My process

- Planning: My planning for this small project was minimal. I didn't document a project plan.
- Analysis: I selected which languages, frameworks and foundations to use. They are TailwindCSS, Create React App, GitHub Pages. I've been focusing on learning TailwindCSS and that's why is chose it over others like Bootstrap.
- Development: Used VS Code as my IDE. I have experience with MacOS and Windows but chose Windows for this project.
- Testing: Included opening the project in multiple browers and different screen sizes. Also, tested on my iPhone with Safari and Google Chrome by hosting my solution on Github Pages.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) - React framework
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I learned about onMouseEnter and onMouseLeave as well as the other event handlers. I used these to show a ```<span>``` when hovering over a bar in a bar graph.

This project took longer than I thought it would. I did add the bonus on hover objective but I still went over the estimated time by roughly 10%. On a small estimate like this, 10% wasn't much time but I'm glad to be getting this time estimation experience.

### Continued development

I would like to spend more time using Figma and calculation project plans. I also plan on implementing more event handlers in future projects. Lastly, I would like to add testing to future projects or come back to this project and add tests. For this project, it would be good to have edge case test for the included data.
